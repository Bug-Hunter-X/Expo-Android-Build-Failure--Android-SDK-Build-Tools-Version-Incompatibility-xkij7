This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves an issue with the Android SDK build tools version. The error message might not be very specific, but it usually points towards incompatibility between the required build tools version and the version installed in your Android SDK.  This can manifest in different ways, such as build failures or errors during the linking stage.
