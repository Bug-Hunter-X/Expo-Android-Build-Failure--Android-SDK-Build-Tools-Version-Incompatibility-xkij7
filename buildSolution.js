To fix this, verify your Android SDK installation.  You can use the Android SDK Manager (in Android Studio or the command line) to check your installed packages and ensure you have the correct version of the build tools specified in your Expo project's configuration. Often updating to the latest stable version resolves the problem.  You can also explicitly set the build tools version in your `gradle.properties` file (typically located in the `android` directory within your project) to force using a specific version, but this must be carefully chosen to be compatible with other project dependencies.
